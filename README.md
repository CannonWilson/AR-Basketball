# AR-Basketball

### Description

As my first foray into AR development, this small project taught me a great deal. I learned how to set up a Unity project using
the experimental Oculus passthrough API. I also created physics materials for the first time to give balls a realistic bounce.
The most important thing I learned from this project was how to create OVR rigs (for the camera) that work with XR rigs and the 
XR Interaction Manager (for user input) in the same scene.

I started by making a player entity that moves and rotates with user input. Then, I created a basic dialogue menu that appears
when a character is approached. The character can choose between dialogue options to respond to the character they approached.

Next, I created a menu that allows the user to arrange words into phrases. The menu has drag and drop functionality, as well as
a button that responds to correct or incorrect input.
